With the new Jetpack Composer features, we can touch the sky, if you can imagine.
For the past few years, Jetpack Compose has been evolving to provide us with a huge amount of magnificent tools.
I am working on a sports-based application, so I had to take my application to the next level.

How do I draw a football playground and add the line-ups for home and away teams?
How do you play with canvas to achieve your purpose?
Ok, all with Canvas and Jetpack compose is possible.
I hope it will be helpful and enjoyable.
